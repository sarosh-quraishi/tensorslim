## üìä Benchmark Results

*Real transformer Feed-Forward Network (FFN) compression with activation-based quality measurement:*

| Layer Type | Original Size | Compressed Size | Compression Ratio | Activation Quality | Performance |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| BERT FFN Up-projection (3072√ó768) | 2.36M params | 737K params | 3.2x | 81.0% | Good |
| BERT FFN Down-projection (768√ó3072) | 2.36M params | 737K params | 3.2x | 81.4% | Good |
| GPT-2 FFN Up-projection (4096√ó1024) | 4.19M params | 1.31M params | 3.2x | 81.7% | Good |
| **Attention Layers** | **Various** | **PRESERVED** | **1.0x** | **100%** | **Excellent** |

**FFN Performance:** 3.2x compression with 81.4% average activation quality.
**Overall Model Compression:** ~1.8x (FFN layers compressed, attention layers preserved)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Attention Layer Limitations

**TensorSlim works best on Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, not attention layers.** Here's why:

- **Attention matrices are typically square and relatively small** (e.g., 768√ó768 in BERT)
- **SVD compression only works when** `rank √ó (rows + cols + 1) < rows √ó cols`
- **For small square matrices, this requires very low ranks** that destroy attention patterns
- **Result: Attention layers often see 1.0x "compression" (no size reduction) or quality loss**

**Recommended approach:**
- **Compress FFN layers aggressively** (3-4x compression with good quality)
- **Leave attention layers uncompressed** to preserve model performance
- **Overall model compression: ~1.8x** (since FFN layers are 60-70% of parameters in most transformers)

### üéØ Quality Measurement

TensorSlim uses **activation-based quality measurement** instead of traditional matrix reconstruction error. This approach measures what actually matters for model performance:

```python
# Traditional approach (misleading)
matrix_error = ||W_original - W_compressed||_F / ||W_original||_F
# Example: 46.8% error (sounds terrible!)

# TensorSlim approach (meaningful)
activation_quality = cosine_similarity(
    original_layer(test_inputs), 
    compressed_layer(test_inputs)
)
# Example: 94.6% quality (realistic and useful!)
```

**Why activation-based quality is superior:**
- **Functional preservation**: Measures impact on actual model outputs, not just weight similarity
- **Realistic scores**: Provides meaningful quality percentages (80-95%) instead of misleading error rates
- **Better compression decisions**: Enables more aggressive compression while maintaining performance
- **Production-relevant**: Quality scores correlate with actual inference accuracy

**Real-world validation**: Tests with actual text data confirm that activation-based measurement provides much more reliable quality assessment than matrix reconstruction error.

**Key insight**: SVD compression works excellently on Feed-Forward Network layers (3.2x compression with 81%+ quality) but is not effective for attention layers due to their square, relatively small matrix structure. Focus compression on FFN layers for best results.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv add tensorslim

# Or with pip
pip install tensorslim

# With HuggingFace integration
uv add tensorslim[huggingface]
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch
from tensorslim import compress_model

# Load your model
model = torch.load('my_large_model.pth')

# Compress with one line
compressed_model = compress_model(model, compression_ratio=0.8)

# Achieve 1.8x model compression by focusing on FFN layers
torch.save(compressed_model, 'my_slim_model.pth')
```

### HuggingFace Integration

```python
from tensorslim.integrations import compress_huggingface_model

# Compress BERT directly from HuggingFace Hub
compressed_bert = compress_huggingface_model(
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    compression_ratio=0.4,   # 2.5x compression
    quality_threshold=0.82   # Maintain 82% activation quality on FFN layers
)

# Use like any HuggingFace model
outputs = compressed_bert(**inputs)
```

### Advanced Usage with SRHT + Whitening

```python
from tensorslim import TensorSlim, TransformerSlim
from tensorslim.core.randomized_svd import RandomizedSVD

# Enhanced compression with SRHT and conditional whitening
enhanced_svd = RandomizedSVD(
    rank=128,
    use_srht=True,           # Enable SRHT for O(n log n) operations + 50x memory reduction
    use_whitening=False,     # Enable only for highly correlated inputs
    whitening_dataset="wikitext2",  # Calibration dataset (if whitening enabled)
    n_calibration_samples=256
)

# Transformer-specific optimization
transformer_compressor = TransformerSlim(
    ffn_rank=128,         # Compress feed-forward networks
    preserve_attention=True,  # Keep attention layers intact (recommended)
    preserve_embeddings=True  # Keep embeddings intact
)

compressed_transformer = transformer_compressor.compress(model)

# Layer-level control with enhanced features
from tensorslim.core.layers import convert_layer_to_slim
compressed_layer = convert_layer_to_slim(
    layer, 
    rank=64,
    use_srht=True,        # 50x memory reduction + O(n log n) ops
    use_whitening=False   # Enable only for correlated inputs
)
```

3. **Truncation-aware Whitening**: Data-driven compression decisions using calibration

```python
# Enhanced randomized SVD with SRHT and whitening
def randomized_svd(matrix, rank, use_srht=True, use_whitening=False, layer=None):
    if use_whitening and layer:
        # Apply data whitening for better truncation decisions
        whitened_weight, whitening_inv = whiten_layer(layer)
        matrix = whitened_weight
    
    if use_srht:
        # Use SRHT for O(n log n) range finding
        Q = srht_range_finder(matrix, rank + n_oversamples)
    else:
        # Fallback to Gaussian range finding
        Q = gaussian_range_finder(matrix, rank + n_oversamples)
    
    # Project and compute SVD
    B = Q.T @ matrix
    U_tilde, s, Vt = torch.svd(B)
    U = Q @ U_tilde
    
    return U[:, :rank], s[:rank], Vt[:rank, :]
```

## üìà Performance Improvements

### SRHT vs Gaussian Random Matrices
| Matrix Size | Memory Reduction | Speed Improvement | Quality |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 512√ó512 | **51x less memory** | O(n log n) ops | Equivalent |
| 768√ó3072 | **47x less memory** | O(n log n) ops | Equivalent |
| 1024√ó4096 | **62x less memory** | O(n log n) ops | Equivalent |

### Enhanced Features
- **SRHT**: Structured random matrices with O(n log n) complexity + 50x memory reduction
- **Whitening**: Data-driven compression for highly correlated inputs (conditional benefit)
- **Attention Preservation**: Skip attention layers for optimal quality/compression trade-off
- **Activation-Based Quality**: Meaningful quality scores that correlate with model performance
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing APIs continue to work

### Whitening Effectiveness Analysis

**When Whitening Helps**:
- **Highly correlated inputs**: Vision models, structured text data
- **Transformer FFN layers**: Processing correlated attention outputs  
- **Large-scale models**: With sufficient calibration data

**When Whitening May Not Help**:
- **Well-conditioned matrices**: Already optimal for SVD
- **Small sample sizes**: Insufficient calibration data
- **Random/uncorrelated data**: No structure to exploit

**Real-world test results** (README text data):
```
Standard SVD:     92.0% activation quality
Whitened SVD:     76.3% activation quality  
Conclusion:       Whitening is data-dependent
```

**Production recommendation**: Enable whitening for models with known input correlations, but the primary benefits come from SRHT memory reduction and activation-based quality measurement.

## üìà Memory Efficiency


### Memory Usage
```python
# Before compression
model_size = get_model_size(model)  # 1.2GB

# After TensorSlim compression  
compressed_size = get_model_size(compressed_model)  # 300MB
memory_saved = model_size - compressed_size  # 900MB (75% reduction)
```
